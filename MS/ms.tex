\section{Data and Results}

The population consists of children in elementary school attending 2nd, 4th and 6th grade. The game was played in couples of children of the same gender. 18 couples (9 female) from 2nd grade, 27 couples (13 female) from 4th grade and 15 couples (10 female) from 6th grade. On average, 2nd graders completed 6.3 trials, 4th graders completed 12.2 trials and 6th graders 17 trials of the game. Without removing the first trials, the fraction of ``success'' trials was 0.14, 0.57  and 0.77 for each grade
respectively. The histograms of the performance are shown in figure \ref{fig:histo_performance}

The CDF for each population (2nd, 4th and 6th grade) was averaged across subjects and the shaded area denotes standard error bars.}

\subsection{The Model}

We implemented the model presented by Shafto et all:

\begin{align}
 P_T (d|h) = \frac{P_L (h|d) P_T0(h)}{P_T(h)} \\
 P_L (h|d) = \frac{P_T (d|h) P_L0(d)}{P_L(d)} \notag
\end{align}

The implementation works as follows. 

\begin{itemize}
 \item Build a binary matrix M of size $E x H$ where E is the number of possible examples to be selected by the teacher and $H$ is the number of possible hypothesis (rectangles). The element $m_{e,h}$ equals 1 if the example $e$ is compatible with the hypothesis $h$ and zero otherwise.
 \item Normalize M column wise to get a matrix $T$
 \item Normalize T row wise to get a matrix $L$
 \item Normalize L colum wise to update $T$
 \item Repeat until T and L converge.
\end{itemize}

After convergence the elements $t_{e,h}$ of matrix $T$ represents the probability $P_T(e|h)$. Conversely $l_{e,h}$ represents $P_L(h|e)$. We performed this iterative process at each move (selected example by the teacher and guessed rectangle by the learner) to yield a model prediction for the next example and guess.
