\section{Data and Results}

The population consists of children in elementary school attending 2nd, 4th and 6th grade. The game was played in couples of children of the same gender. 18 couples (9 female) from 2nd grade, 27 couples (13 female) from 4th grade and 15 couples (10 female) from 6th grade. On average, 2nd graders completed 6.3 trials, 4th graders completed 12.2 trials and 6th graders 17 trials of the game. Without removing the first trials, the fraction of ``success'' trials was 0.14, 0.57  and 0.77 for each grade
respectively. The histograms of the performance are shown in figure \ref{fig:histo_performance}

The left plot shows the distances of the examples with respect to the rectangle seen by the teacher. The right plor shows the distance with respect to the rectangle drawn by the learner. The CDF for each population (2nd, 4th and 6th grade) was averaged across subjects and the shaded area denotes standard error bars.}

\subsection{The Model}

We implemented the model presented by Shafto et all:

\begin{align}
 P_T (d|h) = \frac{P_L (h|d) P_T0(h)}{P_T(h)} \\
 P_L (h|d) = \frac{P_T (d|h) P_L0(d)}{P_L(d)} \notag
\end{align}
